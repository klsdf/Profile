      info: 'Mumu Factor is a variant of RTS game where players need to operate cells to release genes and occupy more territory, ultimately eliminating all enemy forces.\n\nMumu Factor is a work I created during the 2022 Unreal Game Jam.\nThe theme at that time was "selfish genes", so I thought of using the theme of "cell warfare". Let cells send out their own DNA factors to invade each other\'s territory.\nDongdong cells are mutated bad genes that accelerate host aging and infect normal cells.\nMumu factors are also a kind of "good genes" in the host body and also parasitize cells in the host body.\nBecause all the hosts of Mumu factors have been eliminated, Mumu factors began to manipulate the parasitized hosts to fight back.\n\nIn fact, this is a hint at the control of ideology over the people.\nBoth Mumu factors and Dongdong factors represent an ideology or command.\nWhether it is the victory of Mumu factors or Dongdong factors, it is a failure for the host.\n\n\n\nThrough this game, I hope to express not to be wrapped up by ideology. Don\'t fight for others.\nAfter all, the essence of war is that those in power sit in air-conditioned rooms drinking coffee, commanding a group of farmers\' sons to kill another group of farmers\' sons they don\'t know.',
      rulesInfo: 'Mumu Factor is a relatively traditional cell warfare game where players can control cells to attack other cells and occupy all cells.\n1. Both sides start with one cell\n2. Cell genes will automatically increase.\n3. After the player selects cells, right-clicking on enemy cells can attack. Each attack releases half of your gene count. For example, when a player cell is 100, it will release 50 genes to attack the enemy.\n4. If the player\'s genes encounter neutral/enemy cells on the way, they will attack.\n5. The side that loses all cells and genes fails. The player who eliminates other opponents in the game wins.',

That is, "blockade chess" and "Go\'s win rate mode"\nAll pieces must be placed next to one of your pieces, and the pieces will form a root and leaf relationship. Once the root node dies, all leaf nodes die. Pieces consume resources and need to let your pieces differentiate into resource nodes. The overall feeling is somewhat similar to Go. The larger the occupied area, the more resources there are. It\'s just that Go is settled at the end, while this one settles the current territory assets every turn.\nBecause the development cost of designing PvP is high, PvE tower defense design was temporarily adopted.',

Players initially have embryonic cells, which can expand outward, and the expanded cells become stem cells.\n4. Stem cells can differentiate and divide\n5. After stem cells undergo one division, they become growth cells. Growth cells can continue to divide but cannot differentiate.\n6. Only stem cells can differentiate to form attack cells, defense cells, etc.',

      info: 'This game is an experimental narrative game based on AIGC, mainly exploring the manifestation of emergent narrative structures in video games. It attempts to solve several problems with AI in content output and usage scenarios. And makes new breakthroughs in narrative structure for video games.\n\nAI\'s Dilemma\nThe building of today\'s AI has been completed, but there are still two dark clouds floating above.\n1. The contradiction between consistency and diversity of content output\n2. The contradiction between the legality and necessity of usage scenarios\n1. Low threshold and low perception of user input\n\nThe contradiction between consistency and diversity means: if AI provides players with more types of content, its stability will drop significantly, eventually degenerating into a general model. And if more customized content is provided to players, its diversity will drop significantly.\nFor example: If I want to add a custom weapon generation feature to the game. Then\n\nThe contradiction between legality and necessity means: the more the AI\'s usage scenarios are\n\n\n\nTraditional Game Narrative Structure\nTraditional game narrative structures can be roughly divided into 7 types:\n- Linear Narrative\nThe game\'s plot is set from the beginning, and players can only play the game in the set order.\nFor example, The Last of Us\n- Tree Narrative (Branch Narrative)\nThat is, multiple ending narratives. Or certain important operations in the game development will change the game\'s ending.\nFor example, Detroit: Become Human\n- Network Narrative\nIn this structure, it can be one-to-many like tree narrative, or many-to-one, forming an experience similar to "timeline convergence".\nFor example: Cyberpunk 2077\n- Modular Narrative/Fragment Narrative\nIt doesn\'t directly show the plot structure, but pieces together the complete story by collecting clues, diaries, memories, props, etc.\nFor example, the Dark Souls series\n- Open Narrative (Emergent Narrative)\nThis is actually the same as the fragment narrative above. Designers don\'t directly point out the complete plot, but let players guess the plot themselves through various clues and fragment information.\nFor example, The Elder Scrolls V\n\nEmergent Narrative Structure\nThis game uses what I call an emergent structure, a new narrative structure. It is different from all the narrative structures mentioned above.\nBecause all the plot development of the game is driven by "state". Let\'s take the typical story of a hero fighting a dragon as an example. In traditional narrative, the author would use a structure similar to the hero\'s journey to complete the outline of the plot, and then perfect the specific details. The emergent structure is different. The next plot doesn\'t perceive what the previous plot was, but only monitors the state. For example, in the hero fighting the dragon, we set the story to end when the dragon dies. But how the dragon died, this plot doesn\'t perceive. It could be killed by the hero, betrayed by subordinates, or fell to death. In short, the plot development is completely driven by contextual logic.\nThere is a typical logic chain in the game: because I have eyes, I can see. Because I can see, I can know where I am.\nSimilarly, this logic can be completely modified to: because I have ears, because I am a bat, so I can know where I am.\nIn this way, we can build the entire story like building blocks.\nAnd this narrative structure has another feature, that is, it can "break the shackles of parallel worlds". Let\'s take the hero fighting the dragon as an example. When the king learns that the princess has been kidnapped by the dragon, what will he do? He might summon heroes, or develop technology, or train himself to save the princess. These are all possible options. If we choose the first one, then in the game, there will be the following story:\n"Because the king learned that the princess was kidnapped by the dragon, the king summoned heroes."\nIn our narrative structure, the second option doesn\'t represent a new branch plot, but represents a state. States can coexist. At this time, you can choose the second option again. Then the state becomes "the king summoned heroes" and "the king developed technology" at the same time. Under these two states, new plots may be derived: "the hero learned how to use a submachine gun"\nDid you notice? In traditional games, the second option would enter a new story line, but in the emergent structure, it just adds this state.\nTherefore, in this game, you will also see the protagonist being in both the classroom and the bedroom at the same time. This is not a bug, but a feature caused by the emergent structure.',

      info: 'Bubble Meme is a narrative puzzle game. Players need to find things in the game that can be "bubbled".\nThis game uses state-based reasoning in the puzzle part, partially solving the dilemma of traditional click puzzles. Every click by the player learns information instead of entering a completely new state.\nFor example, the first click, the player knows that round things can be clicked, will immediately tell the player that the next step is to click the face. After clicking the face, it tells the player to click the head. The puzzles become more and more abstract later, but the player\'s logic is still very clear. Because this mechanism is equivalent to directly embedding a thinking chain in the puzzle process. Instead of like traditional puzzle games, just giving a bottle and letting the player guess what the bottle can do.\nEvery puzzle requires rethinking.',
